# Project: Invader

Welcome! This is the read me for my personal game project, *Invaders*, which is my personal take on the classic 2D Arcade 80s game *Space Invaders*

In this read me I'll be discussing:

* Technologies Used
* My Approach
* Unsolved Problems

## Technologies Used

This project was primarily composed with JavaScript and HTML Canvas, as well as a little CSS for styling purposes. Furthermore, audio files, sprite sheets, and images both big and small were used to set the atmosphere and bring a personal design and aesthetic to the game.

## My Approach

To tackle a project such as this I focused on framing out the practices I would use and kept in mind the connections I would need to make throughout my code in order to ensure the project was as responsive and user friendly as possible. I used a lot of object oriented programming, mixed in with functions, classes, and constructors as a means to create blueprints for different aspects of the game and to make my code as simple and legible as possible. I even structured my event listeners this way to keep them condensed to avoid any potential console errors produced by scoping conflicts. After mapping out the essential parts of my program like the game loop, collision detection, and object creation, I was then able to tune my project so that it felt like an actual game and gave users an immersive experience by adding audio, a score counter, instructions, and etc..

## Unsolved Problems

My unresolved issues are the following:
 - After satisfying either the winning or losing condition, users aren't able to "Start Over" unless they reload the webpage.
 - Users cannot pause the game.
 - There are no gradual levels.

 # Closing Remarks

 I fully intend to periodically update this project and fix any unresolved issues in order to make it as playable as possible. If you'd liked to keep track of my progress, feel free to visit my [GitHub Pages](https://c-ggreen.github.io/Invader/)

 # Patch Notes
 ### v1.2
 - Start screen added.
 ### v1.1
 - Users can now use the "Enter" key to reload/refresh screen after win or loss condition is met.
